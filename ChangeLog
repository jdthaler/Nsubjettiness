   Rewrote KMeansMinimization to call OnePassMinimization, adding noise explicitly.
   Removed any nothing of noise from OnePassMinimization
   Removed Double32_t for root usage is Nsubjettiness
   Removed most of the TJW flags, after checking that the code was sensible
   Clean up of many comments throughout the code, updating of README file
   Removed unnecessary establishAxes in Njettiness
   Removed bare constructor for Njettiness to avoid incompatibility with enum choices, may reinstate later.  Also removed setMeasureFunction, setAxesFinder for same reason
   NjettinessExtras now calls TauComponents
2014-1-16 <TJ>
   Moved minimization functions to OnePassMinimization, changed KMeansMinimization class to simply call OnePassMinimization a specified number of times
   Added extra tau function in TauComponents for users to get tau directly
   Changed radius parameter in AxesFinderFromExclusiveJet subclasses to use max_allowable_R
   Updated example.ref to account for changes due to change in radius parameter
2014-1-15 <TJ>
   Changed NjettinessComponents to TauComponents
   Updated MeasureFunction with "result" function that returns TauComponents object
   TauComponents changed to calculate all tau components given subtaus_numerator and tau_denominator
   Njettiness updated to return TauComponents object rather than individual components
   Nsubjettiness and NjettinessPlugin updated to have option for 4th parameter
2014-1-14 <TJ>
   Added NjettinessComponents class so Njettiness does not recalculate tau values
   Removed old Njettiness constructors, updated Nsubjettiness and NjettinessPlugin constructors to use new constructor
   Added geometric minimization to OnePassAxesFinders
   Created new Njettiness function to set OnePassAxesFinders to reduce code
   Updated LightLikeAxis with ConvertToPseudoJet function
   Updated README with new functionality of code
2014-1-12 <TJ>
   Removed NsubGeometricParameters in all functions/constructors, replaced with Rcutoff double
   Added three new measure mode options where Rcutoff is declared explicitly in parameters
   Added checks so minimization axes finders are not used for geometric measures
   AxesFinderFromOnePassMinimization class created as child of AxesFinderFromKmeansMinimization
   Added new NsubjettinessRatio constructor to include MeasureMode option
   Moved AxesFinder and MeasureFunction declarations from AxesMode and MeasureMode into separate Njettiness function
   Removed R0 from AxesFinderFromKmeansMinimization
   Changed example.cc to get rid of use of NsubGeometricParameters
2014-1-9 <TJ>
   Removed NsubParameters in all functions/constructors, replaced with three separate parameters
   Added checks for correct number of parameters in Njettiness constructor
2014-1-8 <TJ>
   Removed normalization information from Nsubjettiness
   Added flag to MeasureFunction to give option of using the denominator
   Split DefaultMeasure into separate normalized and unnormalized classes
2014-1-7 <TJ>
   Added capability of choosing a specific Measure in Njettiness
   Added new Nsubjettiness constructor to allow choice of both AxesMode and MeasureMode
2014-1-6 <TJ>
   Updated copyright information
   Fixed bug in WinnerTakeAllRecombiner
   Moved KMeansParameters to AxesFinder
   Updated README with descriptions of new header files
2013-12-30 <TJ>
   Changed name of MeasureFunctor to MeasureFunction
   Created separate .hh/.cc files for MeasureFunction, AxesFinder, and WinnerTakeAllRecombiner
   Updated Makefile to account for new files
   Removed getMinimumAxes in AxesFinderFromKMeansMinimization, consolidated with getAxes
   Updated comments on classes and major functions
2013-12-22 <TJ>
   Created .cc files and moved all function definitions into .cc files
   Updated Makefile to account for new .cc files
2013-11-12 <TJ>
   Added to fjcontrib svn
2013-11-12 <jthaler>
   Debugging svn
2013-11-11 <TJ>
   Changed MeasureFunctor to separately treat tau numerator and denominator
   Changed some of the function names in MeasureFunctor.  Should not affect users
   Added more informative function names to Njettiness.
   Njettiness now allows finding unnormalized tau values
   Added WTARecombiner to define winner-take-all axes
   Added various WTA options to AxesMode
   Added setAxes to Nsubjettiness
   Added NsubjettinessRatio function
2013-08-26 <jthaler>
   Added inlines to fix compile issue
   Put some of the minimization code inside of the AxesFinderFromKmeansMinimization class
2013-02-23 <jthaler>
   Fixed dependency issue (now using make depend)
2013-02-22 <jthaler>
   Fixed memory management and failed make check issues.
