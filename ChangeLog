   Tweaks to NEWS and README.  Preparing for 2.0.0-rc1 release.
2014-4-16 <JDT>
   Decided that enough has changed that this should be v2.0
   Added Id tags
2014-4-14 <JDT>
   Added get_partition_list to MeasureFunction
   Removed do_cluster from MeasureFunction (no longer needed)
   Fixed bug with NjettinessPlugin where jets were listed in backwards order from axes.
   Removed various commented out pieces of code.
2014-3-16 <JDT>
   Added partitioning information to Nsubjettiness
   Partitioning is now calculated in MeasureFunction and stored by Njettiness.
   Rewrote MeasureFunction result() to call result_from_partition()
   Added subjet (and constituent counting) information to example_basic_usage
   Commented out redundant "getJets" function
2014-2-25 <JDT>
   Added access to seedAxes used for one-pass minimization routines.
   Added axes print out to example_basic_usage, and fixed too many PrintJets declarations
2014-2-24 <JDT>
   Fixed embarrassing bug with min_axes (error introduced after v1.0 to make it the same as onepass_kt)
   Simplified GeometricMeasure and added possibility of beta dependence
   Commented out WTA2 options, since those have not been fully tested (nor do they seem particularly useful at the moment).  They can be reinstated if the physics case can be made to use them.
   Split example into example_basic_usage and example_advanced_usage
2014-1-28 <TJ>
   Added new options in WinnerTakeAllRecombiner to use either pT or pT^2/E to recombine particles
2014-1-24 <JDT>
   Added access to currentAxes from Nsubjettiness.
2014-1-18 <JDT>
   Added beam regions to MeasureFunction, correspondingly renamed functions to have jet and beam regions
   Renamed functions in TauComponents for consistency with MeasureFunction
   Adding debugging code to AxesFinderFromOnePassMinimization::getAxes
   Worked extensively on example.cc to make sure that it tests all available options.
   Rewrote PrintJets command in example.cc for later improvements
   Converted some magic numbers to std::numeric_limits<double>::max()
2014-1-17 <JDT>
   Rewrote KMeansMinimization to call OnePassMinimization, adding noise explicitly.
   Removed any nothing of noise from OnePassMinimization
   Removed Double32_t for root usage is Nsubjettiness
   Clean up of many comments throughout the code, updating of README file
   Removed unnecessary establishAxes in Njettiness
   Removed bare constructor for Njettiness to avoid incompatibility with enum choices, may reinstate later.  Also removed setMeasureFunction, setAxesFinder for same reason
   NjettinessExtras now calls TauComponents
2014-1-16 <TJ>
   Moved minimization functions to OnePassMinimization, changed KMeansMinimization class to simply call OnePassMinimization a specified number of times
   Added extra tau function in TauComponents for users to get tau directly
   Changed radius parameter in AxesFinderFromExclusiveJet subclasses to use max_allowable_R
   Updated example.ref to account for changes due to change in radius parameter
2014-1-15 <TJ>
   Changed NjettinessComponents to TauComponents
   Updated MeasureFunction with "result" function that returns TauComponents object
   TauComponents changed to calculate all tau components given subtaus_numerator and tau_denominator
   Njettiness updated to return TauComponents object rather than individual components
   Nsubjettiness and NjettinessPlugin updated to have option for 4th parameter
2014-1-14 <TJ>
   Added NjettinessComponents class so Njettiness does not recalculate tau values
   Removed old Njettiness constructors, updated Nsubjettiness and NjettinessPlugin constructors to use new constructor
   Added geometric minimization to OnePassAxesFinders
   Created new Njettiness function to set OnePassAxesFinders to reduce code
   Updated LightLikeAxis with ConvertToPseudoJet function
   Updated README with new functionality of code
2014-1-12 <TJ>
   Removed NsubGeometricParameters in all functions/constructors, replaced with Rcutoff double
   Added three new measure mode options where Rcutoff is declared explicitly in parameters
   Added checks so minimization axes finders are not used for geometric measures
   AxesFinderFromOnePassMinimization class created as child of AxesFinderFromKmeansMinimization
   Added new NsubjettinessRatio constructor to include MeasureMode option
   Moved AxesFinder and MeasureFunction declarations from AxesMode and MeasureMode into separate Njettiness function
   Removed R0 from AxesFinderFromKmeansMinimization
   Changed example.cc to get rid of use of NsubGeometricParameters
2014-1-9 <TJ>
   Removed NsubParameters in all functions/constructors, replaced with three separate parameters
   Added checks for correct number of parameters in Njettiness constructor
2014-1-8 <TJ>
   Removed normalization information from Nsubjettiness
   Added flag to MeasureFunction to give option of using the denominator
   Split DefaultMeasure into separate normalized and unnormalized classes
2014-1-7 <TJ>
   Added capability of choosing a specific Measure in Njettiness
   Added new Nsubjettiness constructor to allow choice of both AxesMode and MeasureMode
2014-1-6 <TJ>
   Updated copyright information
   Fixed bug in WinnerTakeAllRecombiner
   Moved KMeansParameters to AxesFinder
   Updated README with descriptions of new header files
2013-12-30 <TJ>
   Changed name of MeasureFunctor to MeasureFunction
   Created separate .hh/.cc files for MeasureFunction, AxesFinder, and WinnerTakeAllRecombiner
   Updated Makefile to account for new files
   Removed getMinimumAxes in AxesFinderFromKMeansMinimization, consolidated with getAxes
   Updated comments on classes and major functions
2013-12-22 <TJ>
