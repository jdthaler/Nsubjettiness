The Nsubjettiness package is based on the physics described in:

   Identifying Boosted Objects with N-subjettiness.

   Maximizing Boosted Top Identification by Minimizing N-subjettiness. 
   Jesse Thaler and Ken Van Tilburg. 
   JHEP 1202:093 (2012), arXiv:1108.2701.

There are three different ways to access Nsubjettiness variables:
   Nsubjettiness.hh:  A simple FunctionOfPseudoJet<float> interface to measure N-subjettiness
   NjettinessPlugin.hh:  A FastJet plugin for finding jets by minimizing N-jettiness
   Njettiness.hh:  Core code for N-(sub)jettiness minimization (users typically will not need to use this directly)

The code assumes that you have FastJet 3, though Njettiness.hh should continue to work with FastJet 2.4.3.

Nsubjettiness.hh (i.e. Nsubjettiness functor):

The Nsubjettiness class is a simple wrapper that implements the fastjet::FunctionOfPseudoJet<float> interface for ease of plugging in to other analyses.  Since Nsubjettiness operates the same way as Njettiness, just on constituents instead of all particles in an event, the Nsubjettiness constructor is identical to the one for the plugin (other than the name).

NjettinessPlugin.hh (i.e. Njettiness jet finding plugin):

The Njettiness FastJet plugin represents an exclusive jet finder (yielding a fixed N number of jets). The algorithm finds N axes, and jets are simply the sum of particles closest to a given axis.  Axes can be found by minimizing the event shape Njettiness, exclusive kT, or one-pass minimization from kT seeds, which is much cheaper than full minimization and nearly as effective.

Njettiness.hh (i.e. core Njettiness framework):

Most users will want to use the Nsubjettiness.hh or NjettinessPlugin.hh headers.  For direct access to the Njettiness class, one can use Njettiness.hh directly 

   The basic functionality is given by:

   NsubParameters paraNsub(beta, R0, Rcutoff);
   // beta = 1 for jet broadening, beta = 2 for thrust
   // R0 = normalization jet radius
   // Rcutoff = jet radius cutoff if doing jet finding through minimization
   
   Njettiness nSub(axesMode,paraNsub);
   // axesMode is nsub_kt_axes, nsub_min_axes (100 iterations), nsub_1pass_from_kt_axes, etc..
   
   // get constituents of jet
   vector<PseudoJet> jet_constituents = clust_seq.constituents(some jet);  

   // get tau values
   double tauN = nSub.getTau(N,jet_constituents);

   // get axes used (if desired)
   vector<fastjet::PseudoJet> axes = nSub.currentAxes();

While the code is rather slow in nsub_min_axes mode, for most cases, running with nsub_1pass_from_kt_axes gives reasonable results (and the results are IR safe).  Also, beta = 1.1 is faster than beta = 1, with comparable performance.

The following three header files are used as helper classes for the calculation of N-jettiness and N-subjettiness:

WinnerTakeAllRecombiner.hh:

The WinnerTakeAllRecombiner class defines a new recombination scheme for clustering particles. This scheme recombines
two PseudoJets into a PseudoJet with pT of the sum of the two input PseudoJet pTs and direction of the harder PseudoJet.

AxesFinder.hh:

The AxesFinder class (and derived classes) defines the axes used in the calculation of the event shape N-jettiness. These
axes can be defined from the exclusive jets from a kT or CA algorithm, the hardest jets from an anti-kT algorithm, manually, or from minimization of N-jettiness. 

MeasureFunction.hh:

The MeasureFunction class (and derived classes) defines the measure by which N-jettiness is calculated. This measure is calculated between each particle and its corresponding axis, and then summed and normalized to produce N-jettiness. The default measure for this calculation is pT*dR, where dR is the eta-phi distance between the particle and its axis.
